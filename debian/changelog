    might be needed by those using EGL.

    forces us to do a transition for private symbols even on point releases
    without symbols changes (Closes: #752889).

    been told that with GCC 4.9 this should not be necessary anymore.
  * Remove link to a favicon in a dead url, part of an example.
    The Trolltech site is down and so there is no possible privacy breach in
    it, so just removing the link should suffice.

  * Remove enable_sparc_detection.patch. This is causing a FTBFS in sparc now.
    I've contacted upstream to know the best way to go from here, in the
    meantime we just don't detect it.
  * Update symbols files with buildds' and current logs.
  * Install only the last (and more relevant) changelog. We were trying (and
    failing) to install all of them, but only the first one would end up as
    changelog. As the listing order varies between archs, the final changelog
    will also be different between them, thus not allowing the package to be
    really Multi-Arch: same. Thanks Jakub Wilk for the bug report.

    - Fix related install files.
    - Mark qtbase5-dev, qtbase5-private-dev and libqt5opengl5-dev
      as Multi-Arch: same.
  * Override Lintian warning about torrent.qdoc being under an RFC license,
    it's just a false positive coming from the fact that the documentation is
    listing the license, but it's really not licensed under the RFC license.
  * Update symbols files with buildds' and current logs.

    - enable_s390_detection.patch, applied upstream.
    - change_sparc_qatomic.patch, the code it patches has been removed.
  * Adjust install files.
  * Bump qtbase-abi to qtbase-abi-5-3-0 due to private symbols changes.
  * Make qtbase5-dev-tools-dbg Multi-Arch: same due to qt5-qmake also becoming
    Multi-Arch: same.
  * Add a lintian override for qtbase5-examples: there is no possibility of
    privacy breach in the way trolltech_com.html is used, as it is just parsed,
    but not rendered nor any of the things it points at it's retrieved.

  * QtCore's QNoImplicitBoolCast header is no longer installed. It only had an
    include to qtglobal.h in it and no public symbols are missing.

    - provide qmake mkspec, and use LD_LIBRARY_PATH; patch gnukfreebsd.diff
    - rules: use the gnukfreebsd-g++ when configure'ing
  * Get rid of our glibc-g++ qmake mkspec: it was a mistake with Qt4 (3?)
    already, and it is no more working with non-Linux OSes; as a consequence,
    error out for OSes with no qmake mkspec explicitly set in rules.

  * Bump Build-Depends-Indep qttools5-dev-tools dependency to << 5.1.0~.
  * Do not remove the include dir on cleaning the sources. Prior to Qt 5.1 perl
    would be run and re-create the includes. In 5.1, perl only runs if .git is
    found and the build is done out-of-source. Thanks Pino and Thiago for the
    hints.
  * Fix typo in -no-direcfb switch in configure.
  * Update install files.
  * Update symbols files with current build. The missing symbols seemed to be
    internal/private stuff and optional ones, so everything should be OK.
  * Mark private symbols in symbols files.
  * Add a lintian override for libqt5core5. Symbols should declare a dependency
    on qtbase-abi-5-1-0.
  * Change symbols files and lintian overrides to provide qtbase-abi-5-1-0.
  * Minimal improve of README.source with private symbols handling.
  * Remove doc packages. The build system has changed and I can't build them
    anymore.
    - Remove independent build deps.
    - Remove the doc packages from debian/control.
    - Remove their asociated install files.
    - Remove the indep targets in debian/rules.

  * Mark libgbm-dev as linux-any. Other OSs do not have it.
  * Add the qkms plugin to the armhf list of files to install.
  * Update symbols files.
  * From the armhf build log: "The -arch and -host-arch options are obsolete".
    Remove the relevant armv6 option from debian/rules.
  * Add a lintian override for libqt5xml5, which rightfully declares a
    dependency on qtbase-abi-5-0-2.

  * Update symbols files.

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Also ship 5.conf. This makes calls to qtchooser prettier: qtchooser -qt5.

    it's totally correct for them to do so.

  [ Sune Vuorela ]
  * Prepare symbol files to track private symbols.
  * Make libqt5core5 provide a virtual package to track the non-public api/abi.
  * Create a script to mark symbols as private.

    README.Debian for more details.
  * Fix typo in qtbase5-private-dev's Breaks+Replaces.

    it contains arch-qualified paths in it.
  * Update symbols files.
